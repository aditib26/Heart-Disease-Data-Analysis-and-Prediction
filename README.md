Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. 
The ability to predict heart disease early using clinical data can greatly improve patient outcomes. 
In this project, exploratory data analysis was done and machine learning techniques were employed to build models for heart disease prediction, aiming to identify which factors are most significant in determining whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.
